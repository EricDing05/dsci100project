    "# **The Question**\n",
    "The question we have discussed as a group is: **What kinds of players will contribute the most to the data using playtime as our response variable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "For our **gender categories**, players who identify as **Non-Binary** have the largest positive coefficient, meaning that Non-Binary players are the largest contributors to our response variable (*playtime*) and should be considered highly valuable to the dataset. Additionally, players who identify as **Female** show a strong contribution as well, second only to Non-Binary players. Players who identify as **Male** or **Agender** contribute positively but to a lesser degree than Non-Binary and Female players. The only gender category with a negative coefficient was **Two-Spirited**, indicating reduced engagement or contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our **experience categories**, we have discovered that players with **Regular Experience** show the largest positive contribution to our response variable. They are key to player engagement and should be considered the most valuable group in terms of data contribution for our experience category. Players with **Amateur** and **Pro Experience** also contribute positively, but to a lesser degree than Regular Experience players. Amateur and Pro Experience players still play a significant role in engagement. **Veteran Players** have a negative coefficient, meaning these players are associated with lower levels of engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Was This Expected?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The results that we obtained were **not expected**. This is due to our initial observations of the distribution of our predictor variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our **experience categories**, we observed that most players identified themselves as having **Amateur Experience**, with **Veteran Players** being the second largest group. Given this observation, it seemed reasonable to expect that players who are Veteran or Amateur would contribute the most to our response variable. Instead, players with **Regular Experience**, which is a smaller category, were the most impactful.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our **gender categories**, we observed that players who identify as **Male** were the largest contributors to our initial dataset. Based on this, we expected Male players to contribute the most to playtime. However, it turned out that **Non-Binary** players contributed the most to playtime despite their smaller size in the dataset. Male players came in third in terms of impact for playtime, which was unexpected given their larger representation. We were less surprised by the contribution of **Female** players since they were the second-largest group in the gender categories and contributed the second most to playtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Impact of Findings**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our regression results show that **initial representation does not necessarily predict impact**; instead, groups that are more engaged (e.g., **Non-Binary** and **Regular Experience**) can drive greater contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By targeting groups like those with **Regular Experience** and **Non-Binary** players, engagement can be enhanced further. Addressing the negative contributions of groups like **Veteran Players** and **Two-Spirited Players** could help balance the data and improve engagement overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller, underrepresented groups like **Non-Binary** and **Two-Spirited** players provide insights into how inclusivity affects engagement. There is work to be done to further maintain and enhance their participation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we can develop practices to help target these players for our data. For example:\n",
    "- By focusing on players who are **Non-Binary**, we could recruit more players in these demographics, potentially increasing engagement and playtime.\n",
    "- Developing strategies to engage with more underrepresented groups could bring more diversity to the dataset.\n",
    "- Developers of **Plaicraft** could also create in-game content catered toward underrepresented or major demographics to sustain engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Further Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why did Veteran Players shift from being a large initial group to a negative contributor in our regression analysis?** Does this have something to do with the data or with the psychology of Veteran players? What can Plaicraft do to re-engage with them?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What barriers lead to negative contributions from Two-Spirited players?** Are these related to the game itself, social dynamics, or other factors?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What can be learned from Non-Binary and Regular Experience players?** How can insights from their contributions be leveraged\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What specific features of Plaicraft drive engagement of subscribed players?** Is it because the game is Minecraft, or is there another influence driving engagement?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What are players doing a majority of the time? Are they building, exploring, or pursuing combat?** Within the majority demographic, what specific activities dominate their playtime?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How can Minecraft enhance inclusivity for Non-Binary players through in-game representation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How can Minecraft enhance inclusivity for Non-Binary players through in-game representation?**\n",
    "What role does a player's gender play in influencing preferred game modes or features?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What could Plaicraft do to increase the retention of Non-Binary and Regular Experience players in the long term?**\n"
